### v{{ project.version }}
        
The Morningstar Design System Team is excited to announce 0.x releases! You’ll find our most important components – Buttons, Forms, Data Tables, and more – built with an enhanced Morningstar visual language, all within an alpha preview of our documentation site at http://designsystem.morningstar.com/.

While MDS has begun 0.x releases, current releases are not yet stable. As we progress through 2017Q2, MDS anticipates a 1.0 release mid-year for use in production settings. Nevertheless, the team encourages feedback from the design and engineering communities to tailor assets for integration into specific products.

### About MDS

The Morningstar Design System is a collection of brand, visual, UX, and technical standards built into an HTML & CSS framework so that products can quickly build accessible, high-quality, consistent experiences.

MDS is supported by a system team to build features and collaborate with the Morningstar design and engineering communities. Connect with us on SlackHQ in #mds-engineering and #mds-design channels and via email at designsystem@morningstar.com.
